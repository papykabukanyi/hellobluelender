# Fix Summary - Hempire Enterprise Application

## Duplicate Export Fix

Fixed the duplicate export error in the animations system by:

1. Creating separate component files for animation components:
   - Using existing `src/components/animations/AnimatedCounter.tsx`
   - Using existing `src/components/animations/PageTransition.tsx`
   - Using existing `src/components/animations/ProgressBar.tsx`
   - Using existing `src/components/animations/GrowingLeaf.tsx`

2. Updated the main `src/components/animations/index.tsx` file to:
   - Import all components from their individual files
   - Export them in a single export statement
   - Removed all inline component definitions that were causing duplicate exports

## Next.js SearchParams Fix

Fixed the searchParams handling in the application pages:

- Updated `src/app/application/page.tsx` to properly handle searchParams by adding the `await` keyword
- Updated `src/app/application/success/page.tsx` to properly handle searchParams by removing the unnecessary Promise.resolve()by removing the unnecessary `await Promise.resolve()` call

## Font Update

Applied the Permanent Marker font for all occurrences of "Hempire Enterprise" throughout the application:

1. Set up the font in the application:
   - Added Permanent_Marker import from Google Fonts in `src/app/layout.tsx`
   - Added font configuration for display and subsets
   - Extended the Tailwind configuration to include the font

2. Applied the font to every instance of "Hempire Enterprise" text:
   - Updated Navbar logo to use `font-permanentMarker`
   - Updated Footer headings and copyright text to use `font-permanentMarker`
   - Updated Admin panel branding to use `font-permanentMarker`
   - Added `font-permanentMarker` to all instances in Home page
   - Added `font-permanentMarker` to all instances in ReviewForm
   - Added `font-permanentMarker` to all instances in SignatureForm
   
3. Connected the font to the HTML document:
   - Added the font variable to the HTML element class
   - Updated the Tailwind config to make the font available through all components

These fixes have resolved the build errors and ensured the application appears with consistent branding using the Permanent Marker font as specified.
