# Fix Summary - Hempire Enterprise Application

## Next.js SearchParams Fix

Fixed the searchParams handling in the application pages:

- Updated `src/app/application/page.tsx` to properly handle searchParams by removing the `await` keyword that was causing errors
- Updated `src/app/application/success/page.tsx` to properly handle searchParams by removing the unnecessary Promise.resolve()`

1. Set up the font in the application:
   - Added Permanent_Marker import from Google Fonts in `src/app/layout.tsx`
   - Added font configuration for display and subsets with fallback options
   - Added direct link tags to ensure the font loads properly
   - Extended the Tailwind configuration to include the font

2. Applied the font to every instance of "Hempire Enterprise" text with visual differentiation:

   - Increased font size for "Hempire Enterprise" in body text
   - Added `!important` directives to ensure font styling takes precedence

3. Connected the font to the HTML document:

These fixes have resolved the build errors and ensured the application appears with consistent branding using the Permanent Marker font as specified.
