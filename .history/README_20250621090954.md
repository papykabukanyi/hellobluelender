## Deployment

The application is optimized for deployment on Railway.app. Key features include:

- Proper health check endpoints for monitoring
- Graceful error handling for build and runtime processes

### Health Check Endpoints

The application includes multiple health check endpoints:

- `/health` - Ultra-lightweight endpoint used by Railway's health check system
- `/api/health` - Basic health status with cache prevention headers
- `/api/health/detailed` - Comprehensive health check including Redis connection status

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file with the following variables:

```env
# Redis Configuration
REDIS_URL=redis://...

# SMTP Configuration (for email notifications)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=user@example.com
SMTP_PASS=yourpassword
SMTP_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@example.com
SMTP_FROM_NAME=Blue Lender

# JWT Secret for admin authentication
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the build process on Windows, especially "EPERM" errors related to the `.next` directory:

1. Run the cleanup script: `npm run cleanup`
2. Try building again: `npm run build`

For persistent issues, modify the prebuild script in package.json to bypass the cleaning process.

## Custom Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build production application
- `npm start` - Start production server (from standalone output)
- `npm run cleanup` - Force cleanup of build directories (helps with Windows file locks)
