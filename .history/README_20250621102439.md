## Getting Started

1. Set up your PostgreSQL database and update the `.env.local` file with your connection string
2. Run the database setup:

```bash
npm run prisma:generate
npm run prisma:migrate
npm run db:init
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

See [database-migration.md](./docs/database-migration.md) for more details on the database configuration.

## Admin Access

Default admin credentials:

- **Email**: admin@bluelender.com
- **Password**: admin123

Access the admin area at [http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin)

## API Routes

- **/api/application/submit** - Submit a loan application
- **/api/uploads** - Upload application documents
- **/api/admin/applications** - Manage loan applications
- **/api/admin/email-recipients** - Manage email recipients for notifications
- **/api/admin/smtp-config** - View SMTP configuration (read-only)
- **/api/admin/initialize** - Initialize default admin data
- **/api/auth/login** - Admin authentication
- **/api/auth/logout** - Admin logout
- **/api/auth/verify** - Verify JWT authentication token
- **/api/health** - Health check endpoint for monitoring

## Deployment

The application is optimized for deployment on Railway.app. Key features include:

- Standalone Next.js output for optimized container size
- Proper health check endpoints for monitoring
- Graceful error handling for build and runtime processes

### Health Check Endpoints

The application includes multiple health check endpoints:

- `/health` - Ultra-lightweight endpoint used by Railway's health check system
- `/api/health` - Basic health status with cache prevention headers
- `/api/health/detailed` - Comprehensive health check including Redis connection status

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file with the following variables:

```env
# Redis Configuration
REDIS_URL=redis://...

# SMTP Configuration (for email notifications)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=user@example.com
SMTP_PASS=yourpassword
SMTP_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@example.com
SMTP_FROM_NAME=Hempire Enterprise

# JWT Secret for admin authentication
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the build process on Windows, especially "EPERM" errors related to the `.next` directory:

1. Run the cleanup script: `npm run cleanup`
2. Try building again: `npm run build`

For persistent issues, modify the prebuild script in package.json to bypass the cleaning process.

## Custom Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build production application
- `npm start` - Start production server (from standalone output)
- `npm run cleanup` - Force cleanup of build directories (helps with Windows file locks)

### Testing the Application

To perform a comprehensive test of the application flow:

1. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. In a separate terminal, run the automated test:

   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

   Alternatively, you can run one of the specific test scripts:
   
   ```bash
   npm run test:app            # Main comprehensive CommonJS test script
   npm run test:full-application  # ESM version of the comprehensive test
   npm run test:application-id    # Only test application ID generation
   ```

The comprehensive test:

- Generates and submits 10 test applications with various data combinations
- Includes applications with and without co-applicants
- Validates 6-digit application ID generation
- Ensures all applications are submitted successfully
- Emails application confirmations to the test address
- Verifies signatures are correctly included
- Checks for ID uniqueness and collision rates

**Important Notes:**
- All test emails will be sent to: `papykabukanyi@gmail.com`
- The test verifies proper 6-digit application ID generation
- A successful test will show which application IDs were generated and confirm they are all unique
- Check the email account to verify that both admin and borrower notifications are received
- The test assumes Redis is running and accessible via the configured REDIS_URL

#### Expected Results

A successful test will output something like:
```
