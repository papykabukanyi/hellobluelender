# API Key Security Enhancement

## Summary of Changes Made

As of June 22, 2025, the following security enhancements have been implemented:

1. **Removed hardcoded API keys**: All hardcoded API keys have been removed from the codebase and now properly use environment variables only.

2. **Enhanced environment variable handling**: Updated code to properly retrieve API keys from environment variables with secure fallbacks.

3. **Updated documentation**:
   - Added comprehensive security guidance in `API-KEY-SECURITY.md`
   - Updated `README.md` with proper environment variable guidance
   - Created `.env.local.example` template file with safe placeholder values

4. **Improved .gitignore**: Added additional entries to prevent environment files and history folders (which might contain sensitive data) from being committed.

5. **Created cleanup tools**: Added a script to help clean up any exposed API keys in version history.

## API Key Rotation Required

**IMPORTANT**: If you had access to this repository before June 22, 2025, you must:

1. Immediately revoke and rotate any API keys that were previously hardcoded in the source code
2. Update your `.env.local` file with the new keys
3. Verify no API keys remain in your Git history

## Security Best Practices

Going forward:

1. **NEVER commit API keys or secrets to source control**
2. Always use environment variables for sensitive configuration
3. Regularly rotate API keys
4. Implement least privilege principles for all API keys and access tokens
5. Set up automated secret scanning in your CI/CD pipeline
