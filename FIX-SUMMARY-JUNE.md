## 2. Admin Map Display Issues

### Problem:
The map feature was not displaying correctly for super admin users due to icon loading and client-side rendering issues.

### Solution:
- Fixed Leaflet icon loading with CDN URLs to ensure icons displayed properly

- Improved geocoding API with better error handling and data validation

## 3. Missing Leads Tab for Super Admin

### Problem:
The application lacked a way for super admins to track and manage potential leads from incomplete applications and chat conversations.

### Solution:
- Implemented a new "Leads" tab in the admin sidebar, visible only to super admins
- Created a leads page that displays potential leads from chat sessions and incomplete applications
- Added lead prioritization and filtering capabilities
- Implemented lead management functionality (view details, mark as contacted)

### Technical Details:
- Created `/admin/leads/page.tsx` with a comprehensive UI for lead management
- Added `/api/admin/leads/route.ts` for fetching and filtering leads
- Implemented `/api/admin/leads/[id]/mark-contacted/route.ts` for updating lead status
- Enhanced `AdminLayout.tsx` to conditionally show the Leads tab for super admins only

## 4. Chatbot Lead Capture Functionality

### Problem:
The chatbot was not effectively capturing lead information during conversations.

### Solution:
- Enhanced the chatbot to focus on collecting contact information
- Improved the lead extraction from chat conversations
- Implemented automatic saving of conversations as potential leads
- Added interest level assessment for lead prioritization

### Technical Details:
- Updated `ChatBot.tsx` with improved initial greeting to request contact info
- Enhanced `/api/chat/save-session/route.ts` with better contact information extraction
- Added periodic conversation saving to ensure lead data is captured
- Implemented more comprehensive regex patterns for detecting emails, phones, and names

## 5. Next.js Build Errors

### Problem:
The application had build errors related to parallel routes and deprecated configuration options.

### Solution:
- Removed conflicting health check routes
- Updated Next.js configuration to use current options
- Fixed all TypeScript errors related to component props

### Technical Details:
- Updated `next.config.js` to remove deprecated options
- Resolved route conflicts by consolidating health check endpoints
- Fixed TypeScript type issues in map and chat components
- Documented health check endpoints in `health-check-endpoints.md`

## Conclusion

All identified issues have been successfully resolved, resulting in a fully functional application with proper chatbot integration, admin map display, and leads management system. The application now correctly captures leads from chat conversations and incomplete applications, making them available for super admin review and follow-up.
