# Fix Summary - Hempire Enterprise Application

## Next.js SearchParams Fix

Fixed the searchParams handling in the application pages:

- Updated `src/app/application/page.tsx` to properly handle searchParams by removing the `await` keyword that was causing errors
- Updated `src/app/application/success/page.tsx` to properly handle searchParams by removing the unnecessary Promise.resolve()`

## Font Update

Applied the Permanent Marker font for all occurrences of "Hempire Enterprise" throughout the application with visual distinction:

1. Set up the font in the application:
   - Added Permanent_Marker import from Google Fonts in `src/app/layout.tsx`
   - Added font configuration for display and subsets with fallback options
   - Added direct link tags to ensure the font loads properly
   - Extended the Tailwind configuration to include the font

2. Applied the font to every instance of "Hempire Enterprise" text with visual differentiation:
   - Enhanced CSS styling with text-shadow, color, and sizing to make it stand out
   - Updated Navbar logo to use `font-permanentMarker` with hover effect
   - Updated Footer headings with text-shadow effect
   - Increased font size for "Hempire Enterprise" in body text
   - Added `!important` directives to ensure font styling takes precedence
   - Updated all instances in Home page to be visually distinctive
   - Updated all instances in ReviewForm and SignatureForm
   
3. Connected the font to the HTML document:
   - Added the font variable to the HTML element class

## API Key Security Enhancement

Fixed security vulnerabilities related to exposed API keys:

1. **Removed hardcoded API keys** from the codebase:
   - Ensured all API keys are loaded from environment variables only
   - Updated all instances to use `process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY` instead of hardcoded values

2. **Enhanced documentation**:
   - Added comprehensive API key security guide in `API-KEY-SECURITY.md`
   - Updated `.env.local.example` with secure placeholder values
   - Added clear instructions for key rotation in `API-KEY-SECURITY-ENHANCEMENT.md`

3. **Improved security practices**:
   - Updated `.gitignore` to explicitly exclude all environment files and history
   - Created cleanup script to redact exposed keys in version history

## Next.js Build Error Fixes

Fixed critical build errors:

1. **Resolved parallel routes conflict**:
   - Fixed error: "You cannot have two parallel pages that resolve to the same path"
   - Removed redundant `/health` page component while keeping the API route
   - Added comprehensive health check documentation

2. **Configuration updates**:
   - Removed deprecated `swcMinify` option from `next.config.js`
   - Improved formatting and structure of configuration files

See [NEXTJS-FIXES.md](./NEXTJS-FIXES.md) and [API-KEY-SECURITY-ENHANCEMENT.md](./API-KEY-SECURITY-ENHANCEMENT.md) for details.
   - Added preconnect links for faster Google Font loading
   - Updated the Tailwind config to make the font available through all components

These fixes have resolved the build errors and ensured the application appears with consistent branding using the Permanent Marker font as specified.
