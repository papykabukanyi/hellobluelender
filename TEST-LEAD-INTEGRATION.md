## âœ… **FIXES COMPLETED**

### **1. Pre-Application Lead Creation âœ…**
- **FIXED**: `/api/pre-application/route.ts` now creates lead entries in Redis
- **LOCATION**: `chat:lead:pre_{preApplicationId}` keys in Redis
- **FORMAT**: Same format as chat leads for consistent admin display

### **2. Admin Leads API Enhancement âœ…**
- **UPDATED**: `/api/admin/leads/route.ts` now reads pre-application leads
- **IMPROVED**: Better lead data structure with all captured information
- **ADDED**: Support for `pre-application` source type

### **3. Admin Dashboard Display âœ…**
- **ENHANCED**: `/admin/leads/page.tsx` shows pre-application leads
- **ADDED**: Special highlighting for completed pre-applications
- **IMPROVED**: Comprehensive lead information display
- **FILTER**: Added pre-application filter option

### **4. Lead Data Structure**
```json
{
  "id": "PRE-123456",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe", 
  "email": "john@business.com",
  "phone": "(555) 123-4567",
  "businessName": "Doe Enterprises",
  "businessType": "retail",
  "loanAmount": "50000",
  "monthlyRevenue": "25000",
  "timeInBusiness": "2",
  "creditScore": "720",
  "source": "Chat Bot Pre-Application",
  "status": "New",
  "priority": "high",
  "qualificationScore": 10,
  "notes": "Pre-application submitted via chatbot. ID: PRE-123456. Purpose: Equipment purchase",
  "createdAt": "2025-06-29T..."
}
```

## **ðŸ“‹ Test Flow:**

1. **User Completes Pre-Application via Chatbot**
   - Provides name, email, phone, business info
   - Submits through `/api/pre-application`

2. **System Creates Lead Entry**
   - Stores in `chat:lead:pre_{id}` Redis key
   - Adds to `leads` set for admin access
   - Sends email notifications

3. **Admin Can View Lead**
   - Lead appears in `/admin/leads` dashboard
   - Shows as "Pre-Application (Chatbot)" source
   - Displays all captured information
   - Marked as high priority with score 10/10

## **ðŸŽ¯ Expected Result:**
When a user completes a pre-application via the chatbot and receives an email confirmation, the same information should now appear in the admin leads dashboard with full details and high priority status.
