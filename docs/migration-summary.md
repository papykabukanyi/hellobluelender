# Database Migration Summary

## Changes Implemented

1. **Migrated from Redis to PostgreSQL**:
   - Replaced key-value storage with a proper relational database
   - Set up Prisma ORM for database management
   - Created proper schema with related tables and foreign keys

2. **Implemented 6-digit Application Numbers**:
   - Changed from UUID to 6-digit numbers (100000-999999)
   - Created utility to generate unique 6-digit application IDs
   - Added validation to ensure all application numbers are 6 digits
   - Implemented a test script to verify application ID format

3. **Created Relational Database Structure**:
   - Added tables for all major entities: Application, PersonalInfo, BusinessInfo, etc.
   - Implemented proper foreign key relationships between tables
   - Normalized data to reduce redundancy and improve integrity

4. **Added Migration Scripts**:
   - Created script to move data from Redis to PostgreSQL (`migrate-to-postgres.js`)
   - Added database initialization script (`init-database.js`)
   - Created validation script for 6-digit application IDs (`test-application-id.js`)

5. **Updated API Routes**:
   - Modified all API routes to use PostgreSQL instead of Redis
   - Updated query logic to leverage relational database capabilities
   - Modified application submission to generate 6-digit IDs

6. **Added Documentation**:
   - Created comprehensive database migration guide
   - Updated README files with new database information
   - Added script documentation for the migration process

## Impact on User Experience

- **Application Numbers**: Users now receive 6-digit application numbers instead of UUIDs, making them easier to remember and reference
- **Performance**: Database queries are more efficient with proper indexing and relationships
- **Data Integrity**: Improved validation and constraints ensure data consistency
- **Scalability**: PostgreSQL provides better scalability for future growth

## Next Steps

1. Complete testing of all database functionality
2. Monitor system performance with the new database
3. Consider implementing database backup and disaster recovery procedures
4. Review and optimize database indexes for performance
5. Implement database migration for production deployment
